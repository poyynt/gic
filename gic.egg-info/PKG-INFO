        ### To execute:  
        #### In Linux|Unix|macOS:  
        ##### GUI:  
        Run `gic` in a shell.  
        ##### CLI:  
        Run `gic-cli` in a shell.  
        #### In Windows:
        ##### Method 1:
        In a `cmd` window, change working directory to your desired folder and run `gic`(GUI) or `gic-cli`(CLI).  
        ##### Method 2:
        Copy the file `gic.exe`(GUI) or `gic-cli.exe`(CLI) from `pythoninstallation\Scripts\` to your desired folder and double-click it.  
        #### To use in your python code:  
        A code that the **user** sets the compression level.
        ###### GUI
        ```python
        import gic.main
        #change the working directory to whatever you want
        gic.main.run()
        ```
        ###### CLI
        ```python
        import gic.cli
        #change the working directory to whatever you want
        gic.cli.run()
        ```
        #### To be quiet:  
        A code that **you** set the compression level.
        Set quality to 1|2|3|4 or a percentage. Lower percentage is lower size and lower quality. 1 Means best, 4 means worst.
        ```python
        import gic.compress
        gic.compress.compress(quality)
        ```
        You can also pass another arguement to compress images in that directory.
        ```python
        import gic.compress
        gic.compress.compress(quality, dir)
        ```
